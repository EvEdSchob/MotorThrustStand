# MotorThrustStand
This is the software component of a Raspberry Pi based thrust stand for testing brushless electric motors typically used for remote control airplanes, helicopters, and drones. The device uses a Teensy 4.0 to capture the raw data from the sensors listed below. The data is then passed to a Raspberry Pi 5 for processing and output to both a CSV file and an attached display.
